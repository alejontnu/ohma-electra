# Ohma Electra
CAD and STL files of the Ohma Electra **locomotive**

> **TLDR: Ohma kan kjøre, men også printes**

- More info coming when I remember all I forgot to write about:) 
- Format better as well, yeess
- If you are looking for a train model \*_shudders_\*, you'll have to look elsewhere. 

## About Ohma Electra
Ohma Electra is a single phase electric **locomotive**.

## Discription
The model was originally made with the idea of making a viritual tour of the locomotive, and as such have been made at a 1:1 scale. As the original drawings from 1906 only included the overall dimensions, the placement and size of features have been approximated based on other known dimensions. Details and features of the locomotive have been modelled as close to the real version as possible, with some guesstimates on dimensions where measurements proved hard to get. 

Due to the 1:1 scale of the model, the STL will need to be scaled to the build area when slicing. The two printed models depicted in the images folder were printed at 0.7% and 2.37% scale. 0.7% works well for a keychain size model and from around 2-2.5% most if not all details should be printable on a budget 3D printer. This however also depends on used layer height and line width. The printer I have used is a Creality Ender 3 v2 with a 0.4mm nozzle diameter and printed at 0.12mm layer height. The details would benefit from being printed with a resin printer, but I did not have that available. Additionally, supports **will** be needed for many of the model parts, and post-processing to remove said supports. Some changes to the model have been made to increase strength and make printing slightly easier, but in the interest of keeping the visual of the locomotive, these changes are mostly hidden when assembled.

### Included files

## Future plans (maybe)
- Make myself a Ohma Electra computer case. Some modifications to the outside will be needed to ensure airflow to components and IO connectivity. Also the inside will need to be hollowed and given proper mounting possibilities.
- Wheels and such were made separate in the thought of making an radio controlled **locomotive**, they need some change however to accomodate whatever drive trai..**locomotive** used when that time comes.
- Hollow out the inside and add inside details. May not do this unless the VR idea continuous.
- Segment the model parts even more so that features can be printed individually and assembled afterwards. i.e. railing, plaques, etc.
