## About Ohma Electra
Ohma Electra is a single phase electric **locomotive**.

## Discription
The model was originally made with the idea of making a viritual tour of the **locomotive**, and as such have been made at a 1:1 scale. As the original drawings from 1906 only included the overall dimensions, the placement and size of features have been approximated based on other known dimensions. Details and features of the **locomotive** have been modelled as close to the real version as possible, with some guesstimates on dimensions where measurements proved hard to get. 

Due to the 1:1 scale of the model, the STL will need to be scaled to the build area when slicing. This scaling may affect the fitting tolerances somewhat. The two printed models depicted in the images folder were printed at 0.7% and 2.37% scale. 0.7% works well for a keychain size model and from around 2-2.5% most if not all details should be printable on a budget 3D printer. This however also depends on used layer height and line width. The printer I have used is a Creality Ender 3 v2 with a 0.4mm nozzle diameter and printed at 0.12mm layer height. The details would benefit from being printed with a resin printer, but I did not have that available. Additionally, supports **will** be needed for many of the model parts, and post-processing to remove said supports. Some changes to the model have been made to increase strength and make printing slightly easier, but in the interest of keeping the visual of the **locomotive**, these changes are mostly hidden when assembled.

### Included files
- STL files of the original Solidworks Models
- STEP files if modifications is desired
- Some images for reference of how it looks i.e. colours


- SolidWorks files may follow later idk
- More STEP files may also follow

### Specifics about the model parts...
| Part name | Destription |
|-----------|-------------|
| MainPlatform | The main platform which is the floor one would stand on inside the **locomotive** |
| MainBody | The house body you go inside |
| BodyPlatformAlligner | Small sylinders for ligning up the body and platform parts |
| Boggie | The boggie is where the wheel axle slots into and can rotate under the main_platform |
| Wheel | The wheel and axle |
| AxleLatch | Small peice to secure the wheels to the boggie. One the example print these were not used as the friction due to manufacturing tolerances made the wheel stay in place |
| Keychain | A simple loop to make a keychain out of the **locomotive** |
| Pantograph files | A multi-part that can be assembled to make a simple pantograph. This will likely require post-processing such as sanding down the diameters and sides. An Omega symbol that can be placed within the pantograph to help make it rigid is provided. Other symbols can be made for the same purpose |
| KeyOhma | An all-in-one model with keychain loop in place of the pantograph. The underside of the platform for this all-in-one model have been simplified since a keychain size print would not need these details |

## Future plans (maybe)
- Make myself a Ohma Electra computer case. Some modifications to the outside will be needed to ensure airflow to components and IO connectivity. Also the inside will need to be hollowed and given proper mounting possibilities.
- Wheels and such were made separate in the thought of making an radio controlled **locomotive**, they need some change however to accomodate whatever drive trai..**locomotive** used when that time comes.
- Hollow out the inside and add inside details. May not do this unless the VR idea continuous.
- Segment the model parts even more so that features can be printed individually and assembled afterwards. i.e. railing, plaques, etc.
