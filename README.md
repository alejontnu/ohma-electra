# ohma-electra
CAD and STL files of the Ohma Electra locomotiv on Gl√∏shaugen

## About
Model was originally made for fun as at 1:1 scale. Unless you have a 3D printer capable of producing an 8 meter locomotiv i suggest scaling down the stl when slicing. The two images in the image folder (insert image here, todo, sometime somewhere...) was printed at 0.7% scale and 2.37% scale. 0.7% is perfect for a keychain size model and from around 2-2.5% all details should be printable on a budget 3D printer. 

## Included files
- STL files of the original Solidworks Models (STL files can be viewed directly on GitHub btw)
- STEP files if modifications is desired (and probably needed tbh)
- SolidWorks files may follow later idk
- Some images for reference of how it looks
- More STEP files may also follow
