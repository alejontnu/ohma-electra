# Ohma Electra
CAD and STL files of the Ohma Electra **locomotiv** on Gløshaugen

> **TLDR: Ohma kan kjøre, men også printes**

- More info coming when I remember all I forgot to write about:) 
- Format better as well, yeess
- If you are looking for a train model \*_shudders_\*, you'll have to look elsewhere. 

## About Ohma Electra
Ohma Electra is an **locomotiv** that ... tbc

## Model information
The model was originally made for fun at 1:1 scale. This was done so that an eventual viritual tour of the locomotic could use a life sized model. Unless you have a 3D printer capable of producing an 8 meter locomotiv I suggest scaling down the STL when slicing. The two printed models depicted in the images folder (insert image here, todo, sometime somewhere...) was printed at 0.7% and 2.37% scale. 0.7% is perfect for a keychain size model and from around 2-2.5% most if not all details should be printable on a budget 3D printer. The print I have used is an Creality Ender 3 v2 with a 0.4mm nozzle diameter at 0.12mm layer height. The details would benefit from being printed with a resin printer, but i did not have that available. Additionally, supports **will** be needed for many of the model parts.

### Included files
- STL files of the original Solidworks Models (STL files can be viewed directly on GitHub btw)
- STEP files if modifications is desired (and probably needed tbh)
- SolidWorks files may follow later idk
- Some images for reference of how it looks i.e. colours
- More STEP files may also follow

### Spesifics about the model parts...

## Future maybe plans...
Make myself a pc case from the Ohma model. Who would not want a LOCOMOTIV on their desk?
Wheels and such were made separate in the thought of making an radio controlled **locomotiv**, they need some change however to accomodate whatever drive trai..**locomotiv** used when that time comes
More jokes?
